# Dynamic-Programming
Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. This repository contains all my practice codes on dynamic programming along with the recursive implementations.
